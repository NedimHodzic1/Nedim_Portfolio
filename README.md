# Nedim_Portfolio
This is my portfolio showcasing Data Science projects I have worked on and developed.

# Project 1: A review of basic python programming concepts
* Write a function DateOffset that takes 2 parameters, a string d in the format YYYY-MM-DD and an integer n.
* Write a function Factorial, that takes a positive integer n and returns n factorial (n!) 
* Write a function LongestString, that takes a list of strings and returns a list with the longest strings.
* Write a function IsPalindrome, that takes a string and checks if it is a palindrome.
* Write a function MakeChange that takes 1 parameter, an integer c, between 1 and 99. Using US *coins of denominations $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $0.50 determine the combination needed to make c cents using the fewest coins.

# Project 2: Introduction to Queries, Dataframes, & Data Visualization
* Using pgadmin, create a query to browse to a data base
* Find the first 3 different actors (alphabetically by last name) who have appeared in films rated NC-17. Provide the first name, last name, film title, and release year.
* Read film.csv and categories.xlsx into dataframes
* Plot number of films by category (bar chart)
* Plot average rental duration by category with variance (Box and whiskers)
