* Generated Poisson Distributions using numpy.
* Performed data analysis on a queried dataset.
* Computed summary statistics and plotted distributions.
* Computed correlations between variables and graphed a histogram of results. 

# [Statistical Tests of Variable Significance, Group Comparisons, and Regression](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%206:%20Statistical%20Tests%20of%20Variable%20Significance%2C%20Group%20Comparisons%2C%20and%20Regression)
* Performed ANOVA, T-Test, and Chi-Square tests.
* Compared several groups of data to determine variable significance.
* Built a linear regression model to analyze/visualize the relationship between significant variables in the dataset.

# [Hypothesis Testing, Single Regression Analysis, and Gradient Descent](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%207:%20Hypothesis%20Testing%2C%20Single%20Regression%20Analysis%2C%20and%20Gradient%20Descent)
* Formulated hypothesis given problem statement.
* Performed single regression analysis to test hypothesis. 
* Accepted/rejected null hypothesis comparing significance of two variables.
* Performed Gradient Descent analysis.
* Plotted the loss function over the iterations.

# [Multiple Regression & Assumption Violations](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%208:%20Multiple%20Regression%20%26%20Assumption%20Violations)
* Formulated hypothesis given problem statement.
* Performed multiple regression analysis to test hypothesis. 
* Accepted/rejected null hypothesis comparing significance of two variables.
* Detected assumption violations by testing for the following:
* Collinearity
* Model Fit
* Outliers
* Linearity & Constant Variance
* Normality

# [Predictive Modeling of Used Car Prices](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%209:%20Predictive%20Modeling%20with%20Car%20Prices)
* Built a model of transformed car price based on Power, Engine, Kilometers Driven, and Year
* Filled in missing values with MICE
* Trained model

# [VIF & Scree Plotting of Predictive Model](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%2010:%20VIF%20%26%20Scree%20Plotting%20of%20Predictive%20Model)
* Built a model of transformed car price based on Power, Engine, Kilometers Driven, and Year
* Computed VIF of desired variables
* Utilizied PCA to create principal components and created a scree plot
* Selected 2 components and reran the regression with transformed price to explain variance
