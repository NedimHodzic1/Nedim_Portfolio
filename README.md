This is my portfolio showcasing Data Science projects I have worked on and developed.

# [Project 1: Review of Basic Python Concepts](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201:%20Review%20of%20Basic%20Python%20Concepts)
* Wrote fuctions which return the following to the user :
* String in the YYYY-MM-DD format and an integer n
* Factorials
* Palindrome (T/F)
* Change using integer c between 1 and 99

# [Project 2: Introduction to Queries, Dataframes, & Data Visualization](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%202:%20Introduction%20to%20Queries%2C%20Data%20frames%2C%20%26%20Data%20Visualization)
* Created a query to browse a database (pgadmin).
* Manipulated data and stored it in a pandas dataframe.
* Plotted the films by category & rental duration using Matplotlib.

# [Project 3: Querying Databases & Dataframe Manipulation/Visulatizaiton](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%203:%20Querying%20Databases%20%26%20Dataframe%20Manipulation)
* Queried a database to return a unique dataset using SQL.
* Created and manipated a dataframe using pandas.
* Visualized data distribution.
* Analyzed and drew conculsions from data using performed analysis. 

# [Project 4: Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%204:%20Linear%20Algebra%2C%20Probability%2C%20and%20Statistics)
* Performed various matrix operations.
* Produced normal random distributions.
* Utilizied statistics and numpy toolkits to compute mean, median, mode, variance, sample standard deviation, and standard error.

# [Project 5: Poisson Distrubtion and Analysis](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%205:%20Poisson%20Distribution%20and%20Analysis)
* Produced several random normal distributions of data and performed initial data analysis. 
* Generated Poisson Distributions using numpy.
* Performed data analysis on a queried dataset.
* Computed summary statistics and plotted distributions.
* Computed correlations between variables and graphed a histogram of results. 

# [Project 6: Statistical Tests of Variable Significance, Group Comparisons, and Regression](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%206:%20Statistical%20Tests%20of%20Variable%20Significance%2C%20Group%20Comparisons%2C%20and%20Regression)
* Performed ANOVA, T-Test, and Chi-Square tests.
* Compared several groups of data to determine variable significance.
* Built a linear regression model to analyze/visualize the relationship between significant variables in the dataset.

# [Project 7: Hypothesis Testing, Single Regression Analysis, and Gradient Descent](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%207:%20Hypothesis%20Testing%2C%20Single%20Regression%20Analysis%2C%20and%20Gradient%20Descent)
* Formulated hypothesis given problem statement.
* Performed single regression analysis to test hypothesis. 
* Accepted/rejected null hypothesis comparing significance of two variables.
* Performed Gradient Descent analysis.
* Plotted the loss function over the iterations.

# [Project 8: Multiple Regression & Assumption Violations](https://github.com/NedimHodzic1/Nedim_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%208:%20Multiple%20Regression%20%26%20Assumption%20Violations)
* Formulated hypothesis given problem statement.
* Performed multiple regression analysis to test hypothesis. 
* Accepted/rejected null hypothesis comparing significance of two variables.
* Detected assumption violations by testing for the following:
* Collinearity
* Model Fit
* Outliers
* Linearity & Constant Variance
* Normality
