This is my portfolio showcasing Data Science projects I have worked on and developed.

# Project 1: Review of Basic Python Concepts
* Wrote fuctions which return the following to the user :
* 1. String in the YYYY-MM-DD format and an integer n
* 2. Factorials
* 3. Palindrome (T/F)
* 4. Change using integer c between 1 and 99

# Project 2: Introduction to Queries, Dataframes, & Data Visualization
* Created a query to browse a database (pgadmin).
* Manipulated data and stored it in a pandas dataframe.
* Plotted the films by category & rental duration using Matplotlib.

# Project 3: Querying Databases & Dataframe Manipulation/Visulatizaiton
* Queried a database to return a unique dataset using SQL.
* Created and manipated a dataframe using pandas.
* Visualized data distribution.
* Analyzed and drew conculsions from data using performed analysis. 

# Project 4: Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics
* Performed various matrix operations.
* Produced normal random distributions.
* Utilizied statistics and numpy toolkits to compute mean, median, mode, variance, sample standard deviation, and standard error.

# Project 5: Poisson Distrubtion and Analysis
* Produced several random normal distributions of data and performed initial data analysis. 
* Generated Poisson Distributions using numpy.
* Performed data analysis on a queried dataset.
* Computed summary statistics and plotted distributions.
* Computed correlations between variables and graphed a histogram of results. 

# Project 6: Statistical Tests of Variable Significance, Group Comparisons, and Regression
* Performed ANOVA, T-Test, and Chi-Square tests.
* Compared several groups of data to determine variable significance.
* Built a linear regression model to analyze/visualize the relationship between significant variables in the dataset.

# Project 7: Hypothesis Testing, Single Regression Analysis, and Gradient Descent
* Formulated hypothesis given problem statement.
* Performed regression analysis to test hypothesis. 
* Accepted/rejected null hypothesis comparing significance of two variables.
* Performed Gradient Descent analysis.
* Plotted the loss function over the iterations.
